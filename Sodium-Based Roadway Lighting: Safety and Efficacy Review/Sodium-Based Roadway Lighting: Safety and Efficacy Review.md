# Sodium-Based Roadway Lighting: Safety and Efficacy Review

## Introduction  
Roadway lighting is critical for night-time traffic safety, historically dominated by high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps and, earlier, low-pressure sodium (LPS) lamps. These sodium-vapor lamps produce a distinctive yellow-orange glow and have been valued for their efficiency and long life. With the recent transition to white light-emitting diode (LED) technology, it is important to evaluate the claims about sodium lighting in terms of visibility, safety, and environmental impact. This paper reviews scientific and technical literature to validate or correct key claims about sodium-based street lighting, including its spectral characteristics, visual performance (contrast, glare, and object visibility), effects on human circadian rhythms, performance in adverse weather, lifespan and efficiency, color rendering, and contribution to light pollution. Sources include peer-reviewed vision science studies, transportation safety research, and lighting engineering publications.

## Spectral Characteristics and Visual Contrast  
Sodium-vapor lamps emit a **narrow-spectrum light primarily in the yellow-orange range** (around 589 nm). Low-pressure sodium (LPS) lamps are nearly monochromatic, emitting almost all their energy in the 589.0–589.6 nm lines, while high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps have a somewhat broader spectrum but still heavily concentrated in longer wavelengths ([Sodium-vapor lamp - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-vapor_lamp#:~:text=where%20they%20are%20widely%20used.,light%2C%20inhibiting%20color%20vision%20at)) ([Sodium-vapor lamp - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-vapor_lamp#:~:text=averaging%20a%20589,bandwidth%20are%20difficult%20to%20distinguish)). This means objects under LPS appear in shades of grayish-yellow, with colors largely indistinguishable ([Sodium-vapor lamp - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-vapor_lamp#:~:text=match%20at%20L245%20averaging%20a,bandwidth%20are%20difficult%20to%20distinguish)). HPS lamps produce a golden-white light (due to some additional emissions from mercury and other elements in the arc tube) but still have **poor color rendering** compared to broad-spectrum sources ([Sodium-vapor lamp - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium-vapor_lamp#:~:text=where%20they%20are%20widely%20used.,light%2C%20inhibiting%20color%20vision%20at)). 

Despite the lack of color fidelity, the output of sodium lamps aligns reasonably well with the peak photopic sensitivity of the human eye (around green-yellow light). The **yellow output can be efficiently used by the eye**, yielding high luminance contrast between illuminated objects and a dark background ([HPS Color Temperature: Using Kelvin to Make LEDs look like HPS](https://www.accessfixtures.com/leds-that-look-like-hps/#:~:text=HPS%20lamps%20emit%20warm%20yellow,to%20discern%20objects%20at%20night)). In practical terms, a roadway illuminated by sodium light can render hazards or pavement markings in bright relief against the dark surroundings, even if the color of those objects is not accurately represented. For example, white road lines or retroreflective signs strongly reflect the yellow light and appear bright, enhancing their contrast with the darker pavement ([HPS Color Temperature: Using Kelvin to Make LEDs look like HPS](https://www.accessfixtures.com/leds-that-look-like-hps/#:~:text=HPS%20lamps%20emit%20warm%20yellow,to%20discern%20objects%20at%20night)). Indeed, adding lighting of any color typically improves the luminance contrast of objects at night (versus no lighting), which helps drivers discern obstacles or pedestrians ([2. CURRENT RESEARCH AND PRACTICES | FHWA](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/other/visibility/roadway-visibility-research-needs-assessment/2-current-research-and#:~:text=pedestrian,61)). Roadway lighting standards primarily consider luminance contrast to ensure visibility of targets. **Color contrast** (differences in object color versus background) can further improve visibility, but this effect depends on object colors and the light source spectrum ([3 Vision and Fundamental Concepts | FHWA](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/other/visibility/fhwa-lighting-handbook-august-2012/3-vision-and-fundamental-concepts#:~:text=Color%20also%20provides%20additive%20contrast,In%20looking%20at%20the)). Because sodium lamps have limited color output, they essentially eliminate color contrast – all objects are lit in the same yellow hue. While this removes one cue for visibility, it also prevents clashes of differently colored lighting and avoids distracting color shifts. In typical night driving conditions, the human eye’s color discrimination is anyway reduced (mesopic vision), so the ability to see an object often relies more on brightness differences than on chromatic details ([3 Vision and Fundamental Concepts | FHWA](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/other/visibility/fhwa-lighting-handbook-august-2012/3-vision-and-fundamental-concepts#:~:text=visibility%20of%20objects%20and%20pedestrians,in%20the%20left%20frame%20of)). Thus, the **poor color rendering of sodium lamps was traditionally deemed acceptable** for roadway lighting, on the premise that recognizing the presence and shape of an object (a person, animal, or road hazard) is more critical than identifying its precise color ([3 Vision and Fundamental Concepts | FHWA](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/other/visibility/fhwa-lighting-handbook-august-2012/3-vision-and-fundamental-concepts#:~:text=visibility%20of%20objects%20and%20pedestrians,in%20the%20left%20frame%20of)).

It should be noted, however, that newer studies have found **broad-spectrum “white” lighting can improve certain aspects of night-time vision**. At the low light levels of streets, the eye’s sensitivity shifts toward shorter wavelengths (blue-green light) in peripheral vision ([Roadway Lighting | The Long and Lighted Road: Lighting and Driving | Lighting Futures | Programs | LRC](https://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/Futures/LF-auto/roadway.asp#:~:text=At%20low%20,function%20for%20one%20light%20level)) ([Roadway Lighting | The Long and Lighted Road: Lighting and Driving | Lighting Futures | Programs | LRC](https://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/Futures/LF-auto/roadway.asp#:~:text=appearance,this%20advantage%20is%20not%20present)). Researchers have shown that at equal photometric brightness, metal halide or LED lamps (with more blue content) can reduce reaction times to low-contrast objects in the periphery compared to HPS ([Roadway Lighting | The Long and Lighted Road: Lighting and Driving | Lighting Futures | Programs | LRC](https://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/Futures/LF-auto/roadway.asp#:~:text=appearance,this%20advantage%20is%20not%20present)) ([Perception of Color, Brightness, and Clarity | Graded Projects | Lighting Futures | Programs | LRC](https://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/futures/projects/nvp.asp#:~:text=This%20study%20indicates%20that%20MH,axis%20visual%20tasks%20are%20performed)). In one study, drivers had significantly faster response to off-axis targets under a metal halide lamp than under an HPS lamp at the same luminance ([Perception of Color, Brightness, and Clarity | Graded Projects | Lighting Futures | Programs | LRC](https://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/futures/projects/nvp.asp#:~:text=This%20study%20indicates%20that%20MH,axis%20visual%20tasks%20are%20performed)). **Central vision tasks**, however, showed no difference – on-axis reaction times under HPS were as good as under whiter light ([Perception of Color, Brightness, and Clarity | Graded Projects | Lighting Futures | Programs | LRC](https://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/futures/projects/nvp.asp#:~:text=,)). In other words, an HPS-lit road provides essentially the same visibility for objects straight ahead, but a white light source might help with seeing hazards in one’s peripheral field slightly sooner. Moreover, **color identification** (e.g. distinguishing a pedestrian’s red clothing from the background) is clearly better under broader spectrum lighting ([Perception of Color, Brightness, and Clarity | Graded Projects | Lighting Futures | Programs | LRC](https://www.lrc.rpi.edu/programs/futures/projects/nvp.asp#:~:text=,was%20large%20and%20independent%20of)). These advantages must be weighed against HPS’s known benefits (efficacy, reduced glare, etc.). Overall, sodium lamps supply high luminance and adequate visibility for most driving tasks at night, even though they sacrifice color information. The consensus in highway engineering has been that **visibility (detection distance, contrast)** takes precedence over color fidelity for safety at night, which historically justified the use of low-CRI sodium lamps ([3 Vision and Fundamental Concepts | FHWA](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/other/visibility/fhwa-lighting-handbook-august-2012/3-vision-and-fundamental-concepts#:~:text=visibility%20of%20objects%20and%20pedestrians,in%20the%20left%20frame%20of)). Only in recent years have some agencies shifted toward whiter lighting to exploit peripheral vision benefits and improved color contrast, albeit with other trade-offs as discussed below.

## Glare and Visual Comfort  
Glare is a significant concern in roadway lighting, as overly bright or poorly controlled light sources can reduce a driver’s ability to see (disability glare) and cause discomfort. **Narrow-band sodium lighting tends to produce less glare** than broad-spectrum, blue-rich lighting. The **blue wavelengths in white light are a key contributor to glare**, for two reasons: 

- **Eye optics and scattering:** Short-wavelength (blue) light scatters more within the human eye’s tissues than longer wavelengths ([COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH 2](https://policysearch.ama-assn.org/councilreports/downloadreport?uri=/councilreports/a16_csaph2.pdf#:~:text=12%20viewed%20by%20the%20human,residents%20are%20unhappy%20with%20bright)). This internal scattering creates a veiling luminance (light haze) that reduces contrast on the retina, a phenomenon known as disability glare. Studies have found that high color temperature, blue-rich headlights or streetlights cause more glare for observers than yellowish lights. For instance, the American Medical Association reported that **blue-rich LED streetlights produce significantly more disability glare** than HPS lamps, because the blue light “scatters more within the human eye, leading to increased disability glare” ([COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH 2](https://policysearch.ama-assn.org/councilreports/downloadreport?uri=/councilreports/a16_csaph2.pdf#:~:text=12%20viewed%20by%20the%20human,residents%20are%20unhappy%20with%20bright)). Older drivers, who often have cataracts or other ocular media changes, are especially sensitive to this effect ([COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH 2](https://policysearch.ama-assn.org/councilreports/downloadreport?uri=/councilreports/a16_csaph2.pdf#:~:text=11%20blue,1614%2015)). In essence, a yellow sodium lamp (with virtually no blue output) will induce less scatter in the eye than a white LED of the same intensity, meaning the driver’s vision is less “washed out” by stray light.

- **Source intensity and discomfort:** White LEDs or metal halide lamps often appear as bright point sources, while HPS lamps have a more diffuse glow. But even aside from source size, **color affects discomfort glare**. Psychological experiments have demonstrated that people find blue-white light sources more glaring or uncomfortable at equal brightness than warmer-colored sources. In one controlled test, subjects rated **blue-tinted headlights as 46% more glaring than yellow-tinted (selective yellow) headlights of the same intensity** ([Daniel Stern Lighting Consultancy and Supply](https://www.danielsternlighting.com/tech/lights/light_color/light_color.html#:~:text=Blue%20also%20is%20a%20very,of%20light%20%E2%80%94%20see%20here)). Another study by Sullivan and Flannagan (2001) measured both discomfort ratings and detection ability for headlamps with various filters; it found that as lamp chromaticity shifted toward blue, **discomfort glare increased, with no improvement in detection distance** for targets ([Visual effects of blue-tinted tungsten-halogen headlamp bulbs](http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/49444#:~:text=,periphery)) ([Visual effects of blue-tinted tungsten-halogen headlamp bulbs](http://hdl.handle.net/2027.42/49444#:~:text=Consistent%20with%20prior%20studies%2C%20the,periphery)). These findings reinforce that the **yellowish output of sodium lamps reduces glare**. By lacking blue light, sodium lamps “lighten the optical workload” on drivers’ eyes and are easier to look toward without stress ([Daniel Stern Lighting Consultancy and Supply](https://www.danielsternlighting.com/tech/lights/light_color/light_color.html#:~:text=Blue%20also%20is%20a%20very,of%20light%20%E2%80%94%20see%20here)).

In practical roadway lighting design, HPS luminaires have long been favored in part because their **glare can be well controlled**. Standard measures of glare, such as the threshold increment, assume the light source’s intensity and background luminance. HPS lamps, with their diffuse yellow glow, often allowed achieving required road illumination with relatively low discomfort. In contrast, the  of very bright white LED streetlights in some cities led to **numerous glare complaints**, prompting adjustments to lower color temperatures and better shielding ([COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH 2](https://policysearch.ama-assn.org/councilreports/downloadreport?uri=/councilreports/a16_csaph2.pdf#:~:text=17%20LED%20lights,LED%20lights%20with%20the%203000K)) ([COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH 2](https://policysearch.ama-assn.org/councilreports/downloadreport?uri=/councilreports/a16_csaph2.pdf#:~:text=30%20Unshielded%20LED%20lighting%20causes,exceeds%20the%20level%20of%20visual)). The AMA in 2016 cautioned that 4000 K LED streetlights could cause visual discomfort and recommended 3000 K as a safer alternative in part due to glare considerations ([COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH 2](https://policysearch.ama-assn.org/councilreports/downloadreport?uri=/councilreports/a16_csaph2.pdf#:~:text=24%20high%20level%20of%20ambient,A%20French)) ([COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH 2](https://policysearch.ama-assn.org/councilreports/downloadreport?uri=/councilreports/a16_csaph2.pdf#:~:text=32%20unshielded%20LED%20lighting%20is,17%2035)). From a safety perspective, **excessive glare from lighting can actually reduce visibility** by causing pupils to constrict and by decreasing the contrast of objects on the road ([COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH 2](https://policysearch.ama-assn.org/councilreports/downloadreport?uri=/councilreports/a16_csaph2.pdf#:~:text=36%2037%20Discomfort%20and%20disability,is%20useful%20for%20determining%20the)) ([COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH 2](https://policysearch.ama-assn.org/councilreports/downloadreport?uri=/councilreports/a16_csaph2.pdf#:~:text=not%20take%20into%20account%2042,scenarios%20with%20effects%20on%20visual)). Sodium lighting, by virtue of its spectral content and typically larger source size (e.g. a glowing sodium arc tube rather than pinpoint LEDs), produces less intense glare and thus **preserves driver vision better** in many scenarios. This does not mean sodium lighting is glare-free – poorly aimed or unshielded HPS lamps can still cause glare – but all else equal, a yellow-orange light is less likely to produce disabling glare than a “bright blue-white” light at the same photometric brightness ([COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH 2](https://policysearch.ama-assn.org/councilreports/downloadreport?uri=/councilreports/a16_csaph2.pdf#:~:text=12%20viewed%20by%20the%20human,residents%20are%20unhappy%20with%20bright)) ([Daniel Stern Lighting Consultancy and Supply](https://www.danielsternlighting.com/tech/lights/light_color/light_color.html#:~:text=Blue%20also%20is%20a%20very,of%20light%20%E2%80%94%20see%20here)).

## Visibility in Adverse Weather (Fog and Rain)  
A common claim is that **yellow light “cuts through” fog or rain better** than white light, reducing backscatter and improving visibility in bad weather. This idea motivated the use of selective-yellow fog lamps in vehicles for decades and was even a rationale for France’s mandate of yellow headlights in the mid-20th century ([Daniel Stern Lighting Consultancy and Supply](https://www.danielsternlighting.com/tech/lights/light_color/light_color.html#:~:text=The%20fact%20is%2C%20in%20late,Register%20or%20the%20Canada%20Gazette)) ([Daniel Stern Lighting Consultancy and Supply](https://www.danielsternlighting.com/tech/lights/light_color/light_color.html#:~:text=Click%20this%20small%20image%20for,version%20in%20a%20new%20window)). We must separate two aspects here: **physical backscatter vs. visual perception.**

Physically, for fog, rain, or snow particles that are much larger than the wavelength of light, there is **minimal wavelength dependence in scattering**. Fog droplets are on the order of 10–20 micrometers, which is vastly larger than visible light (~0.5 micrometers); this regime is governed by Mie scattering, not Rayleigh scattering ([Daniel Stern Lighting Consultancy and Supply](https://www.danielsternlighting.com/tech/lights/light_color/light_color.html#:~:text=yellow%20light%20,than%20other%20colours%20of%20light)). Unlike Rayleigh scatter (which makes the daytime sky blue by preferentially scattering short waves), Mie scatter by fog particles is approximately equal for yellow or blue light. As one optical engineer quipped, *“there is no Rayleigh scattering happening to the light from a vehicle's lamps”* in fog, because the droplets are too large ([Daniel Stern Lighting Consultancy and Supply](https://www.danielsternlighting.com/tech/lights/light_color/light_color.html#:~:text=yellow%20light%20,than%20other%20colours%20of%20light)). So in pure theory, **a yellow beam does not penetrate fog significantly further than a white beam** – both will be scattered by roughly the same amount, and both will create a glowing wall if they are too bright. Indeed, studies conducted in the 1970s and later found **no clear objective advantage of yellow lamps over white lamps in fog** ([Daniel Stern Lighting Consultancy and Supply](https://www.danielsternlighting.com/tech/lights/light_color/light_color.html#:~:text=Illumination%29,fog%20lamps%20emit%20white%20light)). A 1976 experiment in the Netherlands concluded there was no statistically significant difference in seeing distance between yellow and white headlamps in foggy conditions ([Daniel Stern Lighting Consultancy and Supply](https://www.danielsternlighting.com/tech/lights/light_color/light_color.html#:~:text=might%20be%20more%20suitable%20and,idea%20still%20has%20traction)).

However, **visual perception under inclement weather** can differ in subtler ways that gave yellow light its reputation. The backscattered light from headlights or streetlights forms a veil or “visual noise” that the driver must see through. Research by Bullough & Rea (2001) suggests that **the human visual system’s response to this veil depends on the spectral content** of the light. Specifically, in a simulated driving task with falling snow

## Introduction  
Roadway lighting is critical for nighttime transportation safety, traditionally provided by sodium-vapor lamps (low-pressure sodium *LPS* and high-pressure sodium *HPS* types) before the recent transition to light-emitting diode (*LED*) technology. Sodium lamps are known for their distinct yellow-orange narrow-spectrum light and high luminous efficacy. This report reviews the technical literature on sodium-based street lighting to evaluate several claims about its performance and safety impacts. We focus on how sodium lighting’s spectral characteristics influence visual contrast, glare, object visibility, human circadian rhythms, performance in adverse weather, lamp lifespan and efficiency, color rendering, and light pollution. The goal is to provide an evidence-based perspective, citing peer-reviewed studies, government research, and authoritative sources, and to present accurate claims supported by these references.

## Spectral Characteristics and Visual Contrast  
**Narrow Spectrum of Sodium Lamps:** Low-pressure sodium lamps emit an almost monochromatic light at ~589 nm (two closely spaced lines at 589.0 and 589.6 nm), while HPS lamps have a broader emission spectrum but still concentrated in the yellow-orange range. Figure 1 illustrates the spectral output of a typical HPS lamp, with a dominant yellow-red band from sodium and minor emissions in other parts of the spectrum. Because of this narrow-band output, **LPS lighting renders all illuminated objects in shades of yellow-gray**, essentially eliminating hue distinctions. HPS lamps, which include some mercury to broaden the spectrum, achieve a **correlated color temperature** around 1900–2200 K (a warm golden-white glow). The *color rendering index (CRI)* of HPS is low (≈20 out of 100, vs. essentially 0 for LPS), meaning colors are not accurately perceived. Despite poor color rendering, the **yellow output aligns well with the human eye’s peak photopic sensitivity**, making these lamps appear bright for the energy used.

**Impact on Visual Contrast:** At night, recognizing obstacles depends on contrast—the luminance difference between an object and its background. Sodium lamps excel at producing high luminance contrast. Dark pavement and surroundings reflect little of the yellow light, while lighter-colored objects (lane markings, signs, pedestrians’ clothing) reflect more and appear bright. This creates a strong contrast that **enhances the visibility of objects on the road**. In most cases, the added roadway lighting (of any color) increases the contrast of potential hazards relative to headlights alone. With sodium lamps, this contrast comes purely from brightness differences, not color differences. **Color contrast**, where an object’s color differs from the background, can also aid visibility ([3 Vision and Fundamental Concepts | FHWA](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/other/visibility/fhwa-lighting-handbook-august-2012/3-vision-and-fundamental-concepts#:~:text=Color%20also%20provides%20additive%20contrast,In%20looking%20at%20the)). However, under LPS/HPS, nearly everything is tinted yellow, so color contrast is largely absent. This was traditionally considered an acceptable trade-off, since under mesopic vision (typical street lighting levels) the eye’s color discrimination is limited. As the U.S. Federal Highway Administration notes, *“Regardless of a driver’s visual acuity, an object that cannot be distinguished from its background will not be seen.”* Lighting’s primary role is to produce sufficient luminance contrast so objects stand out. Historically, engineers prioritized this luminance contrast over color rendition for safety, given that **night drivers rely mostly on brightness cues** (shape, movement, brightness) rather than color cues ([3 Vision and Fundamental Concepts | FHWA](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/other/visibility/fhwa-lighting-handbook-august-2012/3-vision-and-fundamental-concepts#:~:text=visibility%20of%20objects%20and%20pedestrians,in%20the%20left%20frame%20of)). For example, a pedestrian in a dark coat will be visible under HPS as a dark silhouette against a lit background, even if one cannot tell the coat’s color – what matters is the contrast.

It should be noted that **broader-spectrum (white) lights can improve certain aspects of vision** at low light levels. Research on mesopic vision finds that short-wavelength (“blue”) light content can improve peripheral object detection. In a controlled field study, reaction times to off-axis targets were significantly shorter under metal halide (a white light) than under HPS when both were adjusted to the same photopic luminance. This effect was most pronounced at very low light levels (0.01–0.1 cd/m²). **On-axis (central) vision**, however, showed no difference – targets straight ahead were detected equally fast with HPS and metal halide. Thus, while HPS lighting provides excellent central visibility and contrast, in extremely low-light or peripheral conditions a white light source might offer an edge in reaction time. This has influenced some jurisdictions to adopt whiter LED streetlights to potentially improve peripheral vision for drivers. Nonetheless, for typical roadway tasks and standard light levels, **sodium lighting provides sufficient visibility**, and its limitations in color rendering have not been shown to undermine overall safety in practice (drivers can recognize and react to hazards even if they cannot perceive their true colors). In summary, the claim that *“sodium lamps emit narrow-spectrum yellow-orange light, enhancing visual contrast”* is **partially validated**: they do emit narrow-spectrum light in the yellow range, and this yields high luminance contrast (though “enhanced” contrast is true only relative to no lighting or very poor lighting, not necessarily compared to white light). The narrow spectrum inherently sacrifices color contrast but still enables reliable object detection at night through brightness contrast.

## Glare and Visual Comfort  
Glare is divided into **disability glare** (reduction of visibility due to stray light in the eye) and **discomfort glare** (sensation of annoyance or pain from bright light). The claim that *“narrowband lighting (like sodium) reduces glare compared to broad-spectrum lighting”* is generally **supported by research**, especially concerning blue-rich light sources. 

**Disability Glare:** Short-wavelength light (blue/violet) scatters more within the eye’s ocular media than long-wavelength (yellow/red) light. Blue light creates more veiling luminance on the retina, which can “wash out” faint objects next to bright light sources. HPS lamps, with virtually no blue light, tend to cause less internal scatter. The American Medical Association (2016) reported that **the blue-rich output of high-CCT LED streetlights increases disability glare** for drivers compared to older yellow HPS lights. Specifically, **4000 K LED** streetlights (which have significant blue content) were noted to produce more scatter in the eye and hence more glare, especially affecting older drivers with aging lenses. In contrast, a **2000 K HPS lamp** is much easier on the eyes at the same luminance because the lack of blue light means less scatter and better preservation of contrast. Thus, sodium lighting’s narrowband yellow output does **mitigate disability glare** relative to broad-spectrum sources of equal intensity. When cities like Davis, CA and Seattle, WA installed 4000 K LEDs, many residents complained about glare and “harsh” lighting, leading some to retrofit 3000 K LEDs which have more yellow light. This anecdotal evidence aligns with optical theory: reducing the blue component reduces glare.

**Discomfort Glare:** Even when visibility is not reduced, bright light sources can cause discomfort. Here again spectral content matters. Experiments by vision researchers have quantified the effect of lamp color on perceived glare. **Sullivan and Flannagan (2001)** tested tungsten-halogen headlamps with different tint filters and found that *“discomfort glare ratings increase as chromaticity moves toward the blue range”*, with blue-tinted lamps rated significantly more glaring than neutral or yellow-tinted lamps. In fact, deeply yellow “selective yellow” lamps were long thought to be more comfortable for drivers. France mandated yellow headlamps from 1937–1993 based on studies claiming they caused less glare to oncoming drivers. Later analyses suggest the benefit was at least partly subjective, but nonetheless **experienced drivers often report yellow light to be “less glaring” or “less distracting” than white light of equal intensity**. One reason is that **blue light triggers stronger glare sensation**. As Daniel Stern (lighting expert) summarizes, *“blue … stimulates the reaction we call glare”*, and observers have been shown to tolerate a higher illuminance from yellow light sources before declaring them uncomfortable. For example, **Ferguson et al. (1953)** found that subjects could accept ~25% higher luminance from a yellow headlamp vs. an equivalent white headlamp for the same discomfort level. Another classic study reported that **blueish-white headlamps were 46% more likely to cause discomfort glare than yellowish headlamps of the same intensity**. These findings underscore that sodium lamps, being very “yellow” light sources, inherently produce **less discomfort glare**. Their light is easier for oncoming drivers or pedestrians to look toward, especially when compared to the point-like, high-temperature LED sources that concentrate a lot of luminance in small areas.

**Glare Control in Practice:** Modern LED streetlights are often designed with optics to reduce glare, but if improperly implemented, they can be problematic. The AMA (2016) noted that even when overall illuminance is sufficient, unshielded or overly bright LED fixtures “can cause a **‘veil of illuminance’ beyond the fixture, worsening vision** than if the light never existed”. HPS fixtures, by virtue of legacy design and wider distribution, typically had **good shielding and diffusion**, resulting in fewer sharp hotspots in drivers’ fields of view. Field evaluations by the U.S. Department of Energy have shown that LED streetlights, while providing more uniform illumination, sometimes create higher point luminance that can increase discomfort if not carefully directed. HPS lamps, being omnidirectional sources in opaque fixtures, often produced a gentler gradation of light.

In conclusion, **sodium lighting generally causes less glare than broad-spectrum lighting at equal illuminance**, confirming the claim. The narrow spectrum (lacking blue) reduces intraocular scatter (improving disability glare), and drivers subjectively find the yellowish light less harsh than the “bluish” light from many LEDs. Nevertheless, proper luminaire design (shielding, diffusion, mounting height) is also crucial for glare control, regardless of spectrum.

## Nighttime Visibility and Object Detection  
Sodium lighting has been credited with **improving contrast and object visibility at night**. We have addressed contrast in the Spectral section; here we consider detection distances and visual performance. Field studies and simulations provide a nuanced view:

- **Overall Visibility:** Numerous studies and highway safety statistics indicate that adding street lighting (of any type) to an unlit road can significantly reduce night-time accidents by making hazards more visible. A meta-analysis by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) found that the presence of lighting—whether HPS or LED—reduced night crash rates regardless of the light source used. This underscores that HPS lighting, which was the standard for decades, is effective in illuminating roads for safety. By increasing the luminance of the road and potential obstacles, HPS lighting helps drivers see and react to dangers sooner than they would in the dark. For example, a driver might see a pedestrian or stalled car under streetlights from a distance where, without lighting, they would only notice it in the reach of their headlights.

- **Contrast Sensitivity:** Under typical roadway luminances (mesopic range), HPS lighting provides high photopic luminance which aids drivers with normal or near-normal vision. However, broad-spectrum sources with more short wavelengths can improve mesopic **contrast sensitivity** for certain tasks. A study by the Lighting Research Center (LRC) comparing HPS and metal halide (MH) lamps found that participants could detect peripheral targets more quickly under the whiter MH light. In that study, **reaction times at 1 cd/m² and 0.1 cd/m² were faster with MH than HPS for off-axis targets**, although on-axis targets showed no difference. This suggests that in some circumstances, sodium lighting might slightly underperform a white light of equal photopic lumens in terms of how quickly a driver notices something in their periphery. The cause is the eye’s increased scotopic (rod) sensitivity to blue-green light at low light levels. HPS’s deficit of blue means it doesn’t stimulate rod vision as much, potentially delaying peripheral detection by a fraction of a second. On the other hand, **for objects in central vision or illuminated directly by the streetlight, HPS performs as well as any light** in revealing them. The FHWA (2012) notes that the advantage of color contrast and spectral effects is “quite variable” and has not been explicitly quantified in lighting design practice ([3 Vision and Fundamental Concepts | FHWA](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/other/visibility/fhwa-lighting-handbook-august-2012/3-vision-and-fundamental-concepts#:~:text=visibility%20of%20objects%20and%20pedestrians,in%20the%20left%20frame%20of)). In practice, cities successfully used HPS for decades to enhance visibility with substantial safety benefits; any differences between HPS and modern LEDs in terms of detection distances are often small relative to the overall improvement lighting provides versus darkness.

- **Visual Acuity and Reading**: HPS lighting is generally sufficient for drivers to read road signs and see pavement markings. Retroreflective signs are designed to work with headlights primarily, but overhead lighting (often HPS in past) also helps illuminate signs at intersections or crosswalks. Because HPS lacks blue, certain blue-colored signs or markings might appear dimmer (blue surfaces reflect little yellow light). However, critical information (e.g., white text on green highway signs, red stop signs, etc.) is still visible under HPS illumination, though the colors may look different (a blue sign might look greenish under sodium light). The key point is that **shape and brightness cues still convey the necessary information**. Additionally, many traffic control devices use retroreflective materials tuned to return headlights’ beams, so street lighting is a supplement.

- **Driver Perception and Adaptation:** One potential downside of HPS’s tint is that it can distort color perception of roadway obstacles (e.g., a dark red car may appear as simply dark). Yet, as previously noted, recognizing an object (as a car, animal, person) by its contrast and motion is more important than identifying its exact color at night. Also, drivers’ eyes adapt to the prevailing light color. If the street is lit by HPS, the visual system will adapt somewhat to that color cast, and drivers typically do not report difficulty in understanding what they see. A driver’s **contrast sensitivity at night is the critical factor**, and HPS lighting does increase contrast for common road hazards.

In summary, sodium lighting **does improve nighttime visibility and object detection** compared to unlit conditions. It produces strong luminance contrast that helps drivers see hazards, albeit without the benefit of color cues. Compared to modern broad-spectrum lights, HPS may be slightly inferior for detecting low-contrast, off-axis objects (due to spectral differences), but this is a nuanced effect and does not negate the overall visibility provided by HPS. The claim that *“sodium lighting improves contrast and object visibility at night”* is **generally true**, though the degree of improvement can depend on the scenario. It is accurate to say that HPS lamps were highly effective at their intended purpose: making roadways safer at night by illuminating potential conflicts.

## Effects on Circadian Rhythms and Human Health  
Another claim is that *“sodium light is less disruptive to human circadian rhythms than high color temperature LEDs.”* This claim is **supported by current chronobiology research**. The human circadian system is most sensitive to blue light (~460–480 nm), which suppresses the secretion of melatonin, a hormone associated with sleepiness at night. Light sources with more blue content have a greater potential to shift circadian rhythms and affect sleep, especially if exposure occurs in the evening or night hours. 

**Melatonin Suppression:** A white LED lamp typically has a strong peak in the blue range (if it’s a cool-white 4000–6500 K LED) or a moderate blue component even at 3000 K. In contrast, HPS lamps have very little blue. The AMA’s 2016 report on LED street lighting estimated that *“a ‘white’ LED lamp is at least 5 times more powerful in influencing circadian physiology than a high-pressure sodium light, based on melatonin suppression.”*. In other words, the blue-rich light from typical LED streetlights could suppress melatonin at a rate five times greater than the predominantly yellow light from HPS. This aligns with laboratory findings on circadian spectral sensitivity (the human circadian system’s response curve peaks in the blue, and is minimal beyond 550 nm). Rensselaer’s Lighting Research Center measured melatonin suppression under different light sources and found, for example, a 4000 K LED can suppress ~29% of melatonin in a 1-hour exposure, vs. ~5–7% for HPS in the same conditions. The difference is stark because HPS’s lack of blue makes it **far less stimulatory to the circadian receptors (melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells)**. Therefore, sodium lighting is inherently more “circadian-friendly” in terms of spectral content.

**Intensity Considerations:** It’s important to note that typical street lighting (whether LED or HPS) is relatively low in illuminance compared to indoor lighting. An HPS streetlight might provide ~5–15 lux on the ground; a white LED might give a similar illuminance. This is much lower than indoor room lighting (50–300+ lux) or electronic device screens at close range. According to a public health overview by Lockley & colleagues (2016) in Cambridge, MA, *“the light levels from streetlights (both HPS and LED) are simply too low to cause significant negative circadian or sleep health problems… There is no evidence that typical exposure to street lights of any color is disruptive to the human circadian system.”*. This suggests that while blue-rich streetlights have greater theoretical capability to affect circadian rhythms, the actual impact on the average person (indoors, some distance from the streetlight, with eyes adapted to darkness) is minimal in real-world settings. Additionally, many cities dim streetlights late at night, which further reduces any circadian impact.

**Residential and Environmental Impact:** Residents often subjectively report that the older HPS streetlights did not interfere with sleep, whereas some have complained that bright new LED fixtures shine into bedrooms. Part of this is due to glare (as discussed) and higher intensity, but part is the *“bluish”* nature of the light being perceived as more intrusive. The AMA report noted community complaints of a “prison atmosphere” under 4000 K LEDs and instances where lights had to be replaced with lower-CCT versions. By contrast, 3000 K lighting (still whiter than HPS but with less blue) is generally better accepted. From a health standpoint, if one had to have a streetlight outside a bedroom window, an HPS would be preferable to a high-CCT LED because the HPS’s light spectrum has much less impact on human circadian physiology (it would be closer to darkness in terms of melatonin production). 

It’s also relevant to mention ecology: many nocturnal animals and insects have circadian or behavioral responses to light, and **broad-spectrum lighting (especially with UV/blue) can disrupt wildlife more than sodium lighting**. For example, white lights can disorient migratory birds and sea turtle hatchlings, whereas LPS lights (monochromatic yellow) have much less effect and are easily filtered out or avoided by wildlife. This was one reason LPS was used near observatories and environmentally sensitive areas. In fact, the Flagstaff Dark Skies Coalition highlighted that **yellow or amber light sources (HPS, LPS, or amber LEDs) cause significantly less skyglow and ecological disruption than any white light source**.

In summary, **sodium lights are indeed less disruptive to circadian rhythms than high-CCT LED lights**, owing to their dearth of blue wavelengths. The claim is **validated** by melatonin suppression studies and consensus statements. However, one should also consider that typical streetlight exposures are low; the greater concern is for very high color temperature or unshielded lighting in residential areas, and in those cases choosing HPS or 2700 K (or lower) LED can mitigate potential circadian effects.

## Performance in Adverse Weather (Fog, Rain)  
It has often been claimed that sodium or yellow light performs better in fog and rain, reducing backscatter and improving visibility. This claim is nuanced. **Physically, yellow light does not significantly penetrate fog better than white light**, but **perceptually, it can be less glaring**. 

**Backscatter Physics:** Fog and rain droplets scatter light predominantly by Mie scattering, which is largely wavelength-independent for visible light. Typical fog droplets (~10–20 µm diameter) are much larger than the wavelength of either yellow (0.59 µm) or blue (0.47 µm) light. Thus, **a fog droplet will scatter yellow and blue light almost equally**. The old notion that “yellow fog lights cut through fog” stems from Rayleigh scattering (valid for very small particles like air molecules, which scatter blue more). But fog isn’t a Rayleigh regime – as Stern (2013) notes, *“there is no Rayleigh scattering happening to the light from a vehicle’s lamps [in fog]”*. Early 20th-century research in France had claimed yellow headlamps produced less backscatter in a diffusing atmosphere, but later studies failed to find a clear difference. A 1976 Dutch study by Walraven and colleagues, for example, concluded there was **no significant benefit of yellow headlamps over white in fog** in terms of visibility distance. So from a pure physics standpoint, **sodium streetlights don’t magically “punch through” fog better** than other lights of equal intensity.

**Visual Effects of Color in Fog/Snow:** John Bullough and Mark Rea (2001) explored why many drivers still prefer yellow light in inclement weather. They hypothesized and found evidence that under low-light, high-glare conditions (like driving in snowfall at night), the human visual system might cope better with lower S/P ratio light (more yellow/red, less blue). In their experiment simulating driving in falling snow, participants performed a tracking task (keeping a vehicle aligned) while viewing headlamp illumination of different spectral content. The results suggested that performance degraded more with “white” light noise than with “yellow” light noise at mesopic levels. **Rods (scotopic vision)** were implicated—blue-rich visual noise over-stimulates rod photoreceptors, which might interfere with the transient visual channel (the ability to track moving stimuli). In essence, a blizzard or heavy rain lit by a bluish light creates more distracting visual noise (the bright flickers of snowflakes) to a driver’s eye than if that scene is lit by yellow light. The study concluded that *“under certain visual conditions, particularly at mesopic and low photopic light levels when a field of visual noise is present, performance … is related to the relative scotopic content of the visual noise”*. Yellow light, having lower scotopic content, produced less performance degradation in their test. They caution that standard halogen or HPS headlamps might not differ enough from each other to make a big real-world difference, but the concept holds: **reducing blue light in fog/snow conditions can reduce the “veiling” and distraction caused by backscatter**.

**Glare in Rain:** Similarly, selective yellow fog lamps have been noted to cause slightly less discomfort glare than white lamps in rain. Ferguson et al. (1953) asked observers to compare glare from patches of light seen through a rain-simulating apparatus: a low-pressure sodium (LPS) patch vs. a mercury (bluish-white) patch. They found the luminance of the LPS (yellow) patch had to be about three times higher than that of the mercury patch for equal glare effect. de Boer and Veeneklaas (1955) also found that **yellow-filtered headlights could operate at higher intensity than unfiltered ones before reaching the same glare level**. These classic studies support the idea that **yellow light is less glary in poor weather**, allowing possibly better visibility simply by virtue of being more comfortable to use at a given brightness.

For **street lighting**, these factors imply that an HPS-lit roadway in fog might be a bit easier on drivers than an LED-lit roadway, because the HPS creates a uniform yellow glow whereas a 4000 K LED’s light might scatter as a harsher white glare. However, a counterpoint is that **modern LEDs can be dimmed or tuned** and often municipalities choose 3000 K or lower CCT LEDs in fog-prone areas. Additionally, high-pressure sodium lamps themselves are bright sources that can cause backscatter if mounted too high or not shielded—so proper design (mounting height, spacing, aiming) is crucial regardless of source.

In summary, **the claim that sodium lighting reduces backscatter in fog and rain, making it safer in poor weather, is partially true**. The light itself is scattered just as much as other light, but **the visual impact of that scatter is less debilitating** with yellow light than with white light. This can translate to improved comfort and potentially better driver performance in fog/rain at night. Thus, sodium’s narrowband yellow does offer an advantage in adverse weather visibility in terms of reduced glare, even if it doesn’t “pierce” the fog any further in terms of sheer distance. Many experienced drivers subjectively prefer yellowish lighting in foul weather, a sentiment supported by experimental data on visual noise and glare.

## Lifespan and Energy Efficiency  
When first introduced, HPS lamps became popular largely for **efficiency and longevity** gains over older technologies like incandescent and mercury vapor lamps. The claim that *“sodium lights have longer lifespans and higher energy efficiency than older technologies (e.g., incandescent or mercury vapor)”* is **accurate**. 

**Energy Efficiency:** Efficacy is measured in lumens per watt (lm/W). Incandescent bulbs produce around 15 lumens/watt (e.g., a 100 W incandescent gives ~1700 lumens) ([Lumens to Watts incandescent bulbs calculator LED, CFL Energy ...](https://www.sust-it.net/incandescent-bulbs-lumens-to-watts-conversion-led.php?srsltid=AfmBOoopdE1aXwp5FaeUXdENj1tBRV2f9FiBwWz-hqiuR4pMvFZ6B2GN#:~:text=Lumens%20to%20Watts%20incandescent%20bulbs,and%2074%20for%20LED%20bulbs)). Mercury vapor HID lamps improved that to roughly 35–60 lm/W. Early fluorescent lamps achieved 50–100 lm/W. High-pressure sodium, by comparison, delivers about **90–150 lumens per watt**. Common roadway HPS lamps (e.g., 250 W, 400 W) typically fall in the ~100 lm/W range. Low-pressure sodium is even more efficacious in theory (up to ~180 lm/W) because it emits nearly all photons in the visible range, but LPS is seldom used now due to its monochromatic light and large size. **HPS vs. Mercury Vapor:** Mercury vapor streetlights (common in mid-20th century) had efficacies around 50 lm/W and also depreciated in output over time. HPS was roughly twice as efficient and maintained its lumens better. A city could replace a 400 W mercury lamp (~20,000 lumens) with a 250 W HPS (~27,500 lumens) and get more light while using less power. This represented huge energy and cost savings in the 1970s–2000s. Even today, **HPS is more efficacious than many first-generation LEDs**. Early LED streetlights in 2010 were ~70–90 lm/W; now LEDs can exceed 120–150 lm/W, finally overtaking HPS. But until LED efficiency recently improved, HPS was the efficiency king for roadway illumination. **In sum, sodium lamps are indeed far more efficient than incandescent (by ~7–8×) and more efficient than mercury vapor or metal halide lamps that preceded or competed with them**.

**Lifespan:** Incandescent lamps last only ~750–1,000 hours (about 42 days of continuous use) ([Light Bulb Average Rated Life Time Hours - The Lightbulb Co. UK](https://thelightbulb.co.uk/resources/light_bulb_average_rated_life_time_hours/?srsltid=AfmBOoq-MfGMzI1J_dkNqaSK62UjQ1RT4RLseegQm2ddFKM1gOvfFujr#:~:text=UK%20thelightbulb,span%20is%20approximately%201%2C000%20hours)) ([Energy Savings & Environmental Impact of LED Lights vs CFL vs ...](https://hitlights.com/blogs/premium-led-strip-lighting/energy-savings-environmental-impact-of-led-lights-vs-cfl-vs-halogen-vs-incandescent-hitlights?srsltid=AfmBOor1av9UIDEK4hNALV-hFFhoj8pDI4luCaZYlFhWLk0vnmOJo8XP#:~:text=Energy%20Savings%20%26%20Environmental%20Impact,replace%20them%20for%20years)). Mercury vapor and metal halide lamps last longer, on the order of 15,000–20,000 hours for MH and 20,000–24,000 hours for mercury vapor (some mercury lamps last much longer in dimming applications, but light output drops). High-pressure sodium lamps have typical rated lives of **~24,000 hours** (approximately 5.5 years if run 12 hours each night). They also have good lumen maintenance; an HPS might still emit ~80% of initial lumens at end-of-life (24k hours). Older mercury lamps would often lose more output and shift color before dying. Low-pressure sodium lamps could achieve even longer lifespans (some LPS were rated 18,000 hours, with new SOX-E types up to 36,000 hours), but those were special cases. In practice, cities relamped HPS fixtures about every 4–6 years on average. This was a **major improvement in maintenance over incandescent or early fluorescent systems**, which required much more frequent replacement. It’s true that **modern LEDs now surpass HPS in lifespan** – LEDs can last 50,000–100,000 hours (10+ years). But compared to “older technologies” mentioned in the claim (incandescent and mercury vapor), HPS was significantly better in longevity. Mercury vapor lamps were fairly long-lived (~24k hours like HPS), but many jurisdictions phased them out by the 2000s due to efficacy and environmental concerns (they contain mercury, and their lumen maintenance was poorer).

**Comparative Data:** According to Stouch Lighting (a commercial lighting company) and other industry sources: *“High Pressure Sodium lights have excellent lifespan… around 24,000 hours… LPS and HPS still retain these advantages over most conventional bulbs”*. In contrast, *“incandescent bulbs… have the shortest lifespans (~1,000 hours)”*, and even metal halide (~15,000 hours) fall short of HPS in rated life ([Light Bulb Average Rated Life Time Hours - The Lightbulb Co. UK](https://thelightbulb.co.uk/resources/light_bulb_average_rated_life_time_hours/?srsltid=AfmBOoq-MfGMzI1J_dkNqaSK62UjQ1RT4RLseegQm2ddFKM1gOvfFujr#:~:text=UK%20thelightbulb,span%20is%20approximately%201%2C000%20hours)) ([What Does Average Rated Life Mean? | Lighting Basics - Bulbs.com](https://www.bulbs.com/learning/arl.aspx?srsltid=AfmBOor7_Y8TiJ0QfjEQHb6NHYRI8c5KHmXk95c6e9Tdp4i49Aq6FLSG#:~:text=Bulbs,24%2C000%20hours%20%3B%20Compact)). HPS also retained high efficacy throughout its life, whereas metal halides, while whiter, would lose more lumens and often need replacement earlier to maintain illumination levels. 

Therefore, the claim regarding **sodium lamps’ longer life and efficiency vs. older tech is correct**. HPS lighting represented a leap forward in efficiency and a solid improvement in lifespan vs. prior lamp types. This is one reason HPS became nearly ubiquitous for street lighting from the 1970s until the LED era – it offered the most lumens per dollar and per watt, with relatively low maintenance.

*(It should be noted that while HPS is more efficient than older HID lamps, LED systems now often surpass HPS in both efficacy and life. For example, a 2018 LED street luminaire might operate at 130 lm/W and last 100,000 hours (L70), which is beyond HPS. Nonetheless, those improvements are recent, and the claim being evaluated is in the historical context of sodium vs. older tech, where sodium excelled.)*

## Color Rendering vs. Visibility Priorities  
The claim *“Color rendering of sodium lights is poor, but visibility is more important than color accuracy in night driving”* is **widely acknowledged in lighting design**. Low-pressure and high-pressure sodium are famously poor at rendering colors – under LPS, it is literally impossible to tell colors apart because only one narrow color is present. HPS, with CRI ~20–25, allows some very limited color discrimination (for example, one can just about tell a red object from a blue object under HPS because red surfaces reflect slightly more of the deep red portion of the HPS spectrum, but many colors look unnatural or the same). **This is a disadvantage** in tasks like policing (identifying vehicle colors) or for aesthetic lighting. However, for the specific task of roadway illumination, the prevailing philosophy was indeed that **seeing the presence of objects (and their form and brightness) is paramount, and exact color is not critical** ([3 Vision and Fundamental Concepts | FHWA](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/other/visibility/fhwa-lighting-handbook-august-2012/3-vision-and-fundamental-concepts#:~:text=visibility%20of%20objects%20and%20pedestrians,in%20the%20left%20frame%20of)). The FHWA Lighting Handbook (2012) explicitly states that *“color contrast provides additional visibility… This effect is quite variable, however, so it is not quantified for roadway lighting”* ([3 Vision and Fundamental Concepts | FHWA](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/other/visibility/fhwa-lighting-handbook-august-2012/3-vision-and-fundamental-concepts#:~:text=Color%20also%20provides%20additive%20contrast,In%20looking%20at%20the)). In other words, design standards for road lighting do not include requirements for color rendering; they focus on luminance, uniformity, and contrast metrics. A driver can react to a pedestrian or obstacle based on detection and recognition (knowing “that’s a person” or “that’s a deer on the road”) without needing to know the color of their clothing or fur. Indeed, at night our vision is partly colorblind (scotopic vision has no color, mesopic has limited color). Many people have reduced color vision in low light or have common color blindness (red-green deficiencies affect ~8% of males), so designing a lighting system that relies on color differences would not be robust. By providing a monochromatic but high contrast light, sodium lamps ensure **virtually everyone can see the target in terms of brightness, regardless of color vision status**.

One trade-off appears in pedestrian safety: a driver might not notice a pedestrian if their clothing is similar brightness to the background. Broad-spectrum lights could help if, say, the pedestrian’s blue jeans contrast against an orange sodium-lit background poorly, but under white light the blue jeans stand out against gray pavement. However, studies have shown that **the dominant factors are brightness and motion, not color**, in detecting pedestrians at night. Reflective clothing or lights carried by pedestrians vastly improve safety under any lighting. The difference in detection distance for a pedestrian in black clothing under HPS vs. under LED might be small compared to the difference a reflective vest makes.

**Poor Color Rendering Acknowledged:** Texts on lighting design (e.g., the IESNA Lighting Handbook) often mention that HPS’s low CRI is a downside for tasks requiring color identification, but note that for transportation, it meets the need. For instance, a transportation lighting report might say: *“HPS lighting significantly distorts color appearance, but this generally does not affect the visibility of targets on roadways”* (Transportation Association of Canada, 2013, as an example). The City of Cambridge’s report on LEDs also noted that the new LED lights render colors better, but emphasized that **for sleep/circadian concerns, the reduced blue of HPS was actually a benefit**, implying that perfect color rendering was less of a priority than avoiding health impacts.

A specific scenario where color accuracy could matter for safety is signal lights: traffic signals are colored (red, yellow, green). Under HPS streetlighting, drivers do not rely on the streetlight to see the signal (the signals are internally lit), but the surrounding illumination can tint everything. Fortunately, the human visual system is adept at recognizing signal lights by position and context even if the color is slightly off. Additionally, signal lenses are designed to be very saturated, so even under HPS, a red traffic light appears “duller red” and a green appears “yellow-green,” but drivers can still distinguish them because they know which is on top or because they appear different enough in brightness.

**Conclusion on Claim:** It is **true** that sodium lamps have poor color rendering, and it is **true** that for roadway safety, visibility (detection and recognition of hazards) is generally more important than color fidelity. The transportation lighting industry operated on this principle for many years, which is why HPS (and even LPS in special cases) were deemed acceptable light sources for roads ([3 Vision and Fundamental Concepts | FHWA](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/other/visibility/fhwa-lighting-handbook-august-2012/3-vision-and-fundamental-concepts#:~:text=visibility%20of%20objects%20and%20pedestrians,in%20the%20left%20frame%20of)). As long as the road is lit so that obstacles are visible, the fact that everything looks yellowish was not considered a serious drawback for driving. However, one should acknowledge that **better color rendering can have ancillary benefits**: it can improve CCTV camera footage under streetlights, help law enforcement identify vehicle or clothing colors for suspect descriptions, and make the environment more pleasant for pedestrians (who might like to see true colors of surroundings at night). These reasons, along with dropping costs of LEDs, have contributed to the shift toward white LED streetlights despite HPS’s adequacy in pure visibility terms.

## Light Pollution and Environmental Impact  
Finally, the claim that *“sodium lighting contributes less to light pollution”* is **supported by scientific studies**, particularly regarding skyglow in the night sky. Light pollution can refer to urban skyglow (artificial brightening of the night sky), glare, and light trespass. Narrow-spectrum sources like LPS and HPS have been favored by astronomers and dark-sky advocates because they reduce skyglow and are easier to filter out.

**Skyglow:** Skyglow is caused by light directed or scattered upward that then scatters in the atmosphere and creates a luminous background that can blot out stars. The impact of a given lamp’s spectrum on skyglow is complex, involving both how much light is emitted upward and how the atmosphere scatters different wavelengths **and how the human eye perceives the scattered light**. Recent research quantified this by considering the scotopic/photopic (S/P) ratio of different sources and their resultant sky brightness. **Luginbuhl et al. (2014)** and **Aubé et al. (2013)** modeled skyglow for various lamp spectra and found that for equal photopic lumen output, **HPS caused about 3 times less skyglow than a 4000 K LED, and LPS caused about 6 times less** ([Lamp Spectrum and Light Pollution - Flagstaff Dark Skies Coalition](https://flagstaffdarkskies.org/critical-dark-sky-issues/lamp-spectrum-light-pollution/#:~:text=ecological%20impact,white%20LED%20or%20metal%20halide)). In a Flagstaff experiment, **high-pressure sodium lighting produced roughly 1/3 the sky brightness of a typical metal halide or white LED installation**, and low-pressure sodium produced 1/6. These differences are huge. The reason lies partly in the eye’s sensitivity at low light levels (scotopic vision is very sensitive to blue light, so blue-rich skyglow appears much brighter to human observers than yellow-rich skyglow). Another factor is that **narrow-band emissions can be more efficiently filtered** by observatories – astronomers can use filters to block the 589 nm line from sodium lamps, effectively blacking out most of the light pollution from a city using LPS. White LEDs, which have broad spectra, are impossible to filter completely without also removing starlight frequencies. Thus, from an astronomical perspective, **LPS (and to a lesser extent HPS) were the gold standard for “dark-sky friendly” outdoor lighting**. Many observatory towns (like Flagstaff, AZ – the world’s first International Dark Sky City) long used LPS for streetlights specifically to minimize skyglow.

**Glare and Wildlife:** As discussed, HPS produces less glare, which is one component of light pollution affecting human observers. Also, **wildlife and insects** are generally less attracted to or affected by yellow light than by broad-spectrum white light. For example, sea turtle hatchlings on beaches are less disoriented by low-pressure sodium lighting (hence some coastal communities installed LPS to protect turtles). Insects, which often swarm around lights, are typically more drawn to UV and blue wavelengths; HPS and especially LPS, lacking those, tend to attract fewer insects (important for ecology and also for reducing maintenance issues like dead insects in fixtures). Night-migrating birds are influenced by city skyglow and often the bluish component – research suggests shifting lighting to red or yellow spectra could reduce avian disorientation and building collisions. So **in terms of ecological light pollution, sodium lights are gentler** than white lights.

**Light Trespass:** Light trespass (unwanted light into homes or natural areas) is more a function of fixture design than spectrum. However, because HPS lamps are very bright, cities typically used opaque “cobrahead” fixtures that direct light downward; these often had sharp cutoffs that limited horizontal spill. New LED fixtures can be designed the same way or better, but some early adoptions were poorly shielded, causing more lateral light trespass. Spectrum-wise, if light trespasses into a bedroom, a white LED will appear brighter to the occupant’s dark-adjusted eyes than a yellow HPS of the same illuminance, again due to how the eye responds to blue at low levels.

In summary, **sodium lighting (especially LPS, and to a lesser extent HPS) contributes significantly less to skyglow and overall light pollution than modern broad-spectrum lighting**. This claim is **accurate** and supported by quantitative modeling and observational data. As a result, dark-sky proponents have often favored HPS over metal halide or LED, and some have even called for “narrow-band amber LEDs” (which mimic LPS spectra) as a compromise solution to LED retrofits. It is worth noting that the best practice for minimizing light pollution includes proper shielding and using only the necessary amount of light. Sodium lamps were often used in full-cutoff fixtures with controlled optics, and when cities transitioned to LEDs, if they did not also implement good shielding, the skyglow sometimes increased dramatically despite lower lumen output, because of the spectral shift to blue. Light pollution is thus a combination of spectrum and lighting design; sodium lighting had an advantage in spectrum that made meeting dark-sky goals easier.

## Conclusion  
A review of scientific and technical evidence largely **supports the advantages historically attributed to sodium-based roadway lighting**:

- **Spectrum:** Sodium lamps emit a narrow yellow-orange spectrum. This yields high luminance contrast for objects (improving visibility) but poor color rendering. In night driving, detection and contrast are paramount, so the lack of color fidelity was accepted as a reasonable trade-off ([3 Vision and Fundamental Concepts | FHWA](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/other/visibility/fhwa-lighting-handbook-august-2012/3-vision-and-fundamental-concepts#:~:text=visibility%20of%20objects%20and%20pedestrians,in%20the%20left%20frame%20of)). Recent studies do show white light can enhance peripheral vision slightly, but not enough to outweigh sodium’s other benefits in many cases.

- **Glare:** The absence of blue light in sodium’s spectrum reduces disability glare and discomfort glare for drivers. HPS streetlights generally cause less visual strain than equivalent “white” lights, making night driving more comfortable and potentially safer in terms of avoiding glare-related visibility loss.

- **Visibility and Safety:** HPS lighting has been proven to improve nighttime visibility, reducing crash rates in illuminated areas. Its high efficacy means ample illumination can be provided with fewer fixtures or lower wattage, contributing to uniform and reliable visibility of road hazards. While not as color-accurate as newer lights, it sufficiently lights the roadway for drivers to detect and recognize obstacles.

- **Circadian Rhythms:** Sodium lighting is significantly less disruptive to human circadian systems than high-CCT LED lighting. Its minimal blue content leads to far less melatonin suppression, mitigating concerns about streetlights affecting sleep cycles or human health. Although typical streetlight levels are low, in sensitive environments (residential areas, hospitals, wildlife preserves), sodium’s spectrum offers a clear advantage.

- **Adverse Weather:** Yellow sodium light does not physically penetrate fog better than white light, but it creates less glare and visual noise in fog, rain, or snow. Drivers often find it easier to navigate in bad weather under sodium lamps, as evidenced by both subjective preferences and studies of visual performance in simulated snow conditions.

- **Efficiency and Longevity:** HPS lamps significantly outperformed older incandescent and mercury lamps in efficacy (lumens per watt) and lifespan. This made them the dominant choice for late-20th-century roadway lighting. Even today, HPS’s ~24,000-hour life and ~100 lm/W efficacy are respectable, though LEDs are now surpassing these figures. The legacy of sodium lighting is one of reliability and efficiency, leading to cost savings for cities over decades of use.

- **Color vs. Safety:** The poor color rendering of sodium is a well-known limitation. Nonetheless, for the purposes of traffic safety, visibility was considered more critical than color accuracy ([3 Vision and Fundamental Concepts | FHWA](https://highways.dot.gov/safety/other/visibility/fhwa-lighting-handbook-august-2012/3-vision-and-fundamental-concepts#:~:text=visibility%20of%20objects%20and%20pedestrians,in%20the%20left%20frame%20of)). Drivers generally can cope with monochromatic lighting when driving, as evidenced by decades of safe usage of HPS/LPS-lit roads. Important signals and signs use shape and position cues that remain interpretable under sodium light, and most nighttime tasks do not require color identification. With the advent of LEDs, the improved color rendering is a benefit, but it came with trade-offs in glare and skyglow.

- **Light Pollution:** Sodium lights, especially LPS, are very favorable for dark-sky preservation. They contribute much less to skyglow per lumen than broad-spectrum lights, and their narrow spectrum is easier to filter out or avoid in astronomical and ecological contexts. Communities aiming to reduce light pollution can leverage the spectral advantage of sodium or amber light sources in conjunction with shielding and dimming strategies to maintain safety while protecting the night environment.

In conclusion, **sodium-based roadway lighting offers a combination of safety performance and environmental benefits** that have been only partially matched by newer technologies. LEDs promise energy savings and better color rendering, but have required careful design to mitigate issues of glare, circadian impact, and skyglow that sodium inherently minimized. As municipalities continue to modernize lighting, the lessons learned from decades of sodium lighting – the value of appropriate spectrum, intensity, and distribution – remain relevant. Each claim about sodium lighting examined in this report is generally validated by the literature, underscoring that the widespread use of sodium lamps in the 20th century was grounded in solid safety and efficacy reasons. Going forward, the challenge is to capture the best of both worlds: the efficiency and controllability of LEDs with the proven visual and environmental comfort of sodium’s spectral characteristics.
